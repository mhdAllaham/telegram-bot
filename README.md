# File Conversion Bot (PDF ↔ DOCX) 🤖

This bot is built with Python and coverts files from PDF to Word (DOCX) and vice versa.
The maximum supported file size is 10 MB.

## Requirements:
This project is containerized using **Docker**, making it easy to deploy on any free hosting service that supports Docker.

## Webhook Deployment on Free Services (e.g. Render, Koyeb):
Because Koyeb and many other platforms no longer support "Background Workers" on their free tiers, the bot has been updated to use **Webhooks** via a minimal Flask web server.

This allows it to run as a standard "**Web Service**" which is fully supported on free plans!

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Upload the files in this folder (`bot.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`) to a new repository on **GitHub**.
2. Go to [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram to create a new bot and obtain your `BOT_TOKEN`.
3. Create a free account on [Koyeb.com](https://www.koyeb.com/) or [Render.com](https://render.com/).
4. Click on **Create Web Service** and select your **GitHub** repository.
5. In the builder settings, choose **Dockerfile** (or Docker).
6. In the **Environment variables** section, add the following variables:
   - Key: `BOT_TOKEN`
     - Value: (The token you got from BotFather)
   - Key: `APP_URL`
     - Value: (This is your app's public URL once generated by Koyeb/Render, e.g., `https://my-bot-app.koyeb.app`)
7. Ensure the **Service Type** is kept as the default **Web Service**.
8. Select the **Free** instance and click **Deploy**.
9. **CRUCIAL LAST STEP:** After the deployment finishes and the app is live, you must visit your app's main URL in your browser one time (e.g., `https://my-bot-app.koyeb.app/`) to activate the Telegram Webhook!
   - You should see a message saying "Webhook configured beautifully!". Your bot is now ready to use.

## Running Locally:
If you want to test it locally (it will start a local server, to connect it to telegram you might need a tool like ngrok):
1. Install `python`.
2. Install [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/) (This is required for Word to PDF conversion).
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set the bot token environment variable: `set BOT_TOKEN=your_token`
5. Run the bot: `python bot.py`
